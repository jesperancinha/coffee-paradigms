# Coffee paradigms

The goal of this project is to simulate multiple people using a coffee machine throughout the day.

This is not a game, but only a configurable simulator which will allow you to calculate how long fellow employees and colleagues can take to have coffee.

You will be able to:

* Configure the type of coffee they are going to take.

* Follow realtime the usage of the different coffee machines

*NOTE: Under construction*
